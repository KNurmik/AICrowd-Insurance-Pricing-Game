# AICrowd Insurance Pricing Game Submission

This is my submission to the [AICrowd Insurance Pricing Game](https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/insurance-pricing-game). The game consists of using real motor insurance data to predict claims new customers purchasing motor insurance will have, and then using those predictions to develop a pricing strategy and competing with other participants on a lowest-price-wins market.

This was my initial solution and I never found the time to work on it more ;(
