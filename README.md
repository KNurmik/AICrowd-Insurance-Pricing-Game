# AICrowd Insurance Pricing Game Submission

This is my submission to the [AICrowd Insurance Pricing Game](https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/insurance-pricing-game). The game consists of using real motor insurance data to predict claims new customers purchasing motor insurance will have, and then using those predictions to develop a pricing strategy and competing with other participants on a lowest-price-wins market.

My prediction model is currently hovering around in the top 100 among 1400 participants, but I am yet to figure out a successful pricing mechanism. The prediction model consists of manual feature engineering and then using ensembled Random Forest and Gradient Boosting models.
